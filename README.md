# Neversitup Test

1. `README.md` shows my preferred project structure and defined conventions.

To initiate the project structure, I use the `src` directory as the main development location. In this directory, I have only two default files: `App.js` and `index.js`.

I organize the code into four main folders:

1. `routes` => This folder contains components that define the overall page routes.
2. `layout` => Folder for components that act as a wrapper to wrap all page in a specific layout.
3. `components` => This folder is dedicated to reusable React components, helping to reduce duplicate code in the project.
4. `utils` => Utility functions or shared functions are placed in this folder.
